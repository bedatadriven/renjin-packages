## Introduction

The Renjin Continuous Integration system is meant to provide rapid, continuous feedback on the development of the
Renjin interpreter with several goals:

1. Make sure that we can develop aggressive new optimizations with out working about breaking things
2. Measure compatibility with GNU R over time
3. Provide users of Renjin with pre-built artifacts and compatibility information
